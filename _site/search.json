    "text": "2.2 Getting Started\n\nInstall and launch R packages\nThe code chunk below below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto the working R environment.\n\nggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\nggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.\nhrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\npatchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2\n\n\npacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse) \n\n\n\nImporting Data\nThe code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package. readr is one of the tidyverse package.\n\nexam_data <- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\nRows: 322 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (4): ID, CLASS, GENDER, RACE\ndbl (3): ENGLISH, MATHS, SCIENCE\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label(aes(label = ID), \n             hjust = .5, \n             vjust = -.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with ggrepel\nggrepel is an extension of ggplot2 package which provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text as in our examples on the right. We simply replace geom_text() by geom_text_repel() and geom_label() by geom_label_repel().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: ggrepel: 317 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider\nincreasing max.overlaps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Beyond ggplot2 Themes\nggthemes provides ‘ggplot2’ themes that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, Fivethirtyeight, The Economist, ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and The Wall Street Journal, among others. In the example below, The Economist theme is used.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with hrbthems package\nhrbrthemes package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_ipsum()\n\n\n\n\nThe second goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact, this “production workflow” is the context for where the elements of hrbrthemes should be used.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 18,\n              base_size = 15,\n              grid = \"Y\")\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\naxis_title_size argument is used to increase the font size of the axis title to 18,\nbase_size argument is used to increase the default axis label to 15, and\ngrid argument is used to remove the x-axis grid lines.\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Beyond Single Graph\nIt is not unusual that multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, we learn how to create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\nhrbrthemes::import_roboto_condensed()\n\np1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\nNext,\n\np2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\n\nLastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score as shown below:\n\np3 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\nCreating Composite Graphics: patchwork methods\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure will be used.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines: - Two-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +. - Parenthesis () to create a subplot group. - Two-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\nCombining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining three ggplot2 graph\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using: - “|” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs, - “/” operator to place the plots beside each other, - “()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np12 <- p1|p2\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'"

    "text": "4.0 Programming Animated Statistical Graphics with R\n\n4.1 Overview\nWhen telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. IWe will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, we will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n4.1.1 Basic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n4.1.2 Terminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Getting Started\n\n4.2.1 Loading the R packages\nThe code chunk below will check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Importing the data\nThe Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nThe code chunk below imports Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol <- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop <- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %>%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nWarning: `mutate_each_()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0.\nℹ Please use `across()` instead.\n\n\nWarning: `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\nℹ Please use a list of either functions or lambdas:\n\n# Simple named list: list(mean = mean, median = median)\n\n# Auto named with `tibble::lst()`: tibble::lst(mean, median)\n\n# Using lambdas list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nread_xls() of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\nmutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\nmutate of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer.\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Animated Data Visualisation:gganimate methods\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_()/exit_() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n4.3.1 Building a static population bubble plot\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Building the animated bubble plot\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Animated Data Visualisation: plotly\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n\n4.4.1 Building an animated bubble plot: ggplotly() method\nIn this sub-section, we will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\n\ngg <- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nWarning in geom_point(aes(size = Population, frame = Year), alpha = 0.7, :\nIgnoring unknown aesthetics: frame\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\nWarning in p$x$data[firstFrame] <- p$x$frames[[1]]$data: number of items to\nreplace is not a multiple of replacement length\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nAppropriate ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot. The output is then saved as an R object called gg.\nggplotly() is then used to convert the R graphic object into an animated svg object.\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Building an animated bubble plot: plot_ly() method\nIn this sub-section, we will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using plot_ly() method.\n\nbp <- globalPop %>%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Old, \n          y = ~Young, \n          size = ~Population, \n          color = ~Continent, \n          frame = ~Year, \n          text = ~Country, \n          hoverinfo = \"text\",\n          type = 'scatter',\n          mode = 'markers'\n

Funnel Plots for Fair Comparisons\n\n11.1 Overview\nFunnel plot is a specially designed data visualisation for conducting unbiased comparison between outlets, stores or business entities. By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting funnel plots by using funnelPlotR package,\nplotting static funnel plot by using ggplot2 package, and\nplotting interactive funnel plot by using both plotly R and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\n\n11.2 Installing and Launching R Packages\nFive R packages will be used. They are:\n\nreadr for importing csv into R.\nFunnelPlotR for creating funnel plot.\nggplot2 for creating funnel plot manually.\nknitr for building static html table.\nplotly for creating interactive funnel plot.\n\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, FunnelPlotR, plotly, knitr)\n\n\n\n11.3 Importing Data\nIn this section, COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta will be used. The data was downloaded from Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta portal. We are going to compare the cumulative COVID-19 cases and death by sub-district (i.e. kelurahan) as at 31st July 2021, DKI Jakarta.\nThe code chunk below imports the data into R and save it into a tibble data frame object called covid19.\n\ncovid19 <- read_csv(\"data/COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta.csv\") %>%\n  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)\n\nRows: 267 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): City, District, Sub-district\ndbl (4): Sub-district ID, Positive, Recovered, Death\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n11.4 FunnelPlotR methods\nFunnelPlotR package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a numerator (events of interest), denominator (population to be considered) and group. The key arguments selected for customisation are:\n\nlimit: plot limits (95 or 99).\nlabel_outliers: to label outliers (true or false).\nPoisson_limits: to add Poisson limits to the plot.\nOD_adjust: to add overdispersed limits to the plot.\nxrange and yrange: to specify the range to display for axes, acts like a zoom function.\nOther aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc.\n\n\n11.4.1 FunnelPlotR methods: The basic plot\nThe code chunk below plots a funnel plot.\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  numerator = covid19$Positive,\n  denominator = covid19$Death,\n  group = covid19$`Sub-district`\n)\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 0 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroup in this function is different from the scatterplot. Here, it defines the level of the points to be plotted i.e. Sub-district, District or City. If Cityc is chosen, there are only six data points.\nBy default, data_typeargument is “SR”.\nlimit: Plot limits, accepted values are: 95 or 99, corresponding to 95% or 99.8% quantiles of the distribution.\n\n\n\n11.4.2 FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 1\nThe code chunk below plots a funnel plot.\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  numerator = covid19$Death,\n  denominator = covid19$Positive,\n  group = covid19$`Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",     #<<\n  xrange = c(0, 6500),  #<<\n  yrange = c(0, 0.05)   #<<\n)\n\nWarning: The `xrange` argument deprecated; please use the `x_range` argument\ninstead.
