    "text": "This chapter introduces several ggplot2 extensions for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. We will be able to:\n\ncontrol the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,\ncreate professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,\nplot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n2.2 Getting Started\nInstall and launch R packages\nThe code chunk below below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto the working R environment.\n\nggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\nggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.\nhrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\npatchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2\n\n\npacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse) \n\nImporting Data\nThe code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package. readr is one of the tidyverse package.\n\nexam_data <- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\nRows: 322 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (4): ID, CLASS, GENDER, RACE\ndbl (3): ENGLISH, MATHS, SCIENCE\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n2.3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label(aes(label = ID), \n             hjust = .5, \n             vjust = -.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with ggrepel\nggrepel is an extension of ggplot2 package which provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text as in our examples on the right. We simply replace geom_text() by geom_text_repel() and geom_label() by geom_label_repel().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: ggrepel: 317 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider\nincreasing max.overlaps\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Beyond ggplot2 Themes\nggthemes provides ‘ggplot2’ themes that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, Fivethirtyeight, The Economist, ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and The Wall Street Journal, among others. In the example below, The Economist theme is used.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\nWorking with hrbthems package\nhrbrthemes package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_ipsum()\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family not\nfound in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family not\nfound in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family not\nfound in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact, this “production workflow” is the context for where the elements of hrbrthemes should be used.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 18,\n              base_size = 15,\n              grid = \"Y\")\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family not\nfound in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\naxis_title_size argument is used to increase the font size of the axis title to 18,\nbase_size argument is used to increase the default axis label to 15, and\ngrid argument is used to remove the x-axis grid lines.\n\n2.5 Beyond Single Graph\nIt is not unusual that multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, we learn how to create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\nhrbrthemes::import_roboto_condensed()\n\np1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\nNext,\n\np2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\n\nLastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below:\n\np3 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")"
